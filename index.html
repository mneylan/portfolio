        A take on the popular children’s books, 3 characters from Where’s Waldo are hidden throughout the map and the user is tasked with finding them. The backend is built with Ruby on Rails and the frontend with React. The database stores the x and y coordinates of the characters on the map, as well as a list of players and their scores. At the start and end of the game, a Ruby DateTime object is created, with the difference being the player’s score. When a user clicks on the board and selects a character, the Fetch API makes a call to the backend to check if the character is near where they clicked. Another Fetch call at the end of the game displays a list of high scores with an option for the user to add their name to the list.

        Browse the new fall selection at Avalon Interior Lighting, for all your lighting needs. Made using React, this mock e-commerce site allows users to browse the items in the shop and add them to a shopping cart. Features increment and decrement buttons that can update an item's quantity without typing. Clicking the cart icon will dim the shop background while the cart slides into view, showing a list of all selected items and their respective cost. React Router is utilized to provide routes to the home and shop pages of the site.
